An Open Source SBC (Single Board Computer) design based on <b>Allwinner V3s</b>. 

<b>Allwinner V3s</b> is a single core 1GHz Cortex-A7 Processor embedded with 64MB DDR2 RAM.

This SoC is primarily aimed for dashcam applications, and it supports MIPI & parallel CSI controllers, LCD Display controller, audio codec, EMAC + PHY, etc.
The SoC is available in a 128 pin QFP package. The embedded DDR memory greatly simplifies the PCB layout, and gives the flexibility to use a simple 2 layer PCB design for the SBC.

Eventhough the SoC is a bit outdated, All these perks makes this a go-to option for Hobbyists and Makers.

There are multiple open source designs available based on the <b>V3s</b> (check the resources.md file). The aim of this project is to get started with embedded Linux systems, and get some good exposure to the Hardware and Software.

Few of the Applications I have in mind besides as a development kit - Home automation, Private MQTT broker/IoT server, Spotify box, etc.

<h3>Work in progress......</h3>


 Currently in Planning/High level Design phase. 
 Overall you can expect basic interfaces like GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, 10/100Mbps Ethernet, WiFi/BT, and a standard 40 pin FPC connector for LCD display.
 
 This plan might vary depending on component availability. Also I may design this as a single board development kit or a combo of 1 main card and multiple add on cards (options for WiFi/BT, LCD display, CSI camera, Audio Amp,etc.)
 
 <b>Updates will be very slow.</b> Design progress will be depending on my free time after work and personal commitments, but stay tuned.......
